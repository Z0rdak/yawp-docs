# [0.6.2-beta1] - 2025-10-30

## Added

- Add flag `no-hunger` and `keep-inv` back.

## Changed

- Set default value for `op_bypass_flags` to `false` in `yawp-common.toml` to prevent unexpected behavior for server operators.
- Add flag command no longer supports the override argument. This caused confusion when adding flags.
- Rename flag `knockback-players` to `no-knockback`. Clarification: It prevents players from being knocked back.

## Fixed

- Fix issues loading region data (again) causing region data loss.
- Fix flags considered _beneficial_ for players not working as intended. This includes, beside others:
    - `keep-inv`
    - `no-hunger`
    - `keep-xp`
    - `invincible`
    - `no-knockback`
- Fix `spawning-trader` flag not preventing wandering trader llamas from spawning.
