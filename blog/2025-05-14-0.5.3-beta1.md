# [0.5.3-beta1] - 2025-05-17

This version states the changes need for the YAWP port for Minecraft 1.21.5.

## Added

- Italian translation. Thanks to ZIOMARK#1358
- Brazilian Portuguese translation. Thanks to MATIASTGM#7157

## Changed

- **Breaking changes** to region data saving and loading!
- `yawp-dimensions.dat` is split up in multiple files:
    - `dimensions.dat`: stores a list of dimensions managed by YAWP
    - `global.dat` : global region data
    - and then a file for each dimension managed by YAWP so for `minecraft:overworld` it would be `minecraft_overworld.dat`. It stores the dimension region and the local regions for the overworld.

## Fixed

- Fix CME during region hierarchy resolving, causing server to crash on startup
