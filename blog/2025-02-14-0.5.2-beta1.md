# [0.5.2-beta1] - 2025-02-14

## Added

- Contributions guideline (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- (**API**) Add getting started section in README
- (**API**) Add usage section in wiki
- Added new flags: 
  - `keep-inv`
  - `keep-xp`
  - `no-item-despawn` [PR#142](<https://github.com/Z0rdak/Yet-Another-World-Protector/pull/142>)
  - `no-hunger`
- Added additional command for region deletion in local region commands: `/yawp local <dim> <region> delete -y`


<!-- truncate -->

## Changed

- Disable flag check/result logging by default
- Improve hint and add link to add flag when it does not exist in region

## Removed

- Remove `/wp` command alternative and switch to just `/yawp` as the base cmd. This prevents trouble regarding the config and command registration and as well as questions why commands not work (looking at you JourneyMap!)
- Remove `wp_root_command` config option from `yawp-common.toml`

## Fixed

- Fix project setup not working on MAC due to missing dependencies. Added minecraft repo, to include lwjgl files to allow booting. [PR#143](<https://github.com/Z0rdak/Yet-Another-World-Protector/pull/143>)
- Fix RegionMarker not resetting
- (**Breaking change**) Fix typo in snow-smelting flag. It's not properly called `snow-melting`. You'll need to add this flag again in your regions.
- Fix region data dump causing errors when size is too big. For now dump is limited to a certain region size.
