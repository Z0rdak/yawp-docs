Hi there! 👋

Welcome to the YAWP wiki. Here you will find a (hopefully) complete set of documentation for the mod _Yet Another World Protector_, showing you how to install, setup, configure and effectively use YAWP.

## What is YAWP you ask? 

Yet Another World Protector (YAWP for short) is a server-side mod (plugin), for Fabric, Forge and NeoForge, which allows you to protect your creations of your minecraft server against various events and actions from players, mobs and the environment itself.

It was inspired by the forge mod [WorldProtector](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldprotector) and the [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard) plugin.

***The mod is currently in its beta state and active development - with many features not yet implemented, but to come. These features will, beside others, include most of the things you know from WorldProtector and WorldGuard.***

## Where to start

If you are new to YAWP or _World Protection Mods_ in general, we suggest just starting at the top and working your way through the wiki. 

The basic concepts are covered in detail in the [Concepts](concepts/overview) pages.

The command reference can be found in the [Commands Overview](commands/overview.md) and its subpages.

But why bother with typing commands when you instead can use the [Interactive CLI](interactive-cli/overview) for almost anything. 🙂

Also take a look at [Getting Started](getting-started/installation).
