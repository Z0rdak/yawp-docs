## Command overview

These pages show all mod commands available to manage your regions. 
The base command for YAWP is `/yawp`.

Usually you would start by display information about the dimension you are standing in (by using `/yawp dim <dim> info`) and go from there with the help of the interactive CLI. This way you can mostly avoid using commands manually.

Refer to the pages below for more information on the commands available for each different sub command:

## Base commands

* `/yawp global ...`: [Global Region commands](region/global-commands.md)
* `/yawp dim <dim> ...`: [Dimensional Region commands](region/dimension-commands.md)
* `/yawp local <dim> <local> ...`:  [Local Region commands](region/local-commands)
* `/yawp marker ...`:  [Marker commands](marker/marker-commands)
* `/yawp flag ...`:  [Flag commands](flag/flag-commands)

# [Flag commands](flag/flag-commands.md)

The flag command provides advanced management of region flags. It can be used to manage flags for all types of regions.

As with most commands, you don't have to type them manually. You can use the interactive CLI to navigate the flag list and change the flag settings.
