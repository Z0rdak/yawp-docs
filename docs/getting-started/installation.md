## Requirements

Although we try to limit dependencies, YAWP needs some additional library mods to run. Be sure to have them installed before starting your server with YAWP installed.

- [Forge Config API Port](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-config-api-port-fabric) YAWP uses FCAP for its configuration. You might need this dependency depending on your used version.
- [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) (Fabric only)


## Installation 

YAWP is a server-side mod. You will only need it on your server. 
Just put the mod file into your `mod` directory and you are ready to go.

Want to run YAWP in a singleplayer world via LAN? No problem, it works the same as using it on a dedicated server.

Additionally, you can install it on the client to gain some quality of life features.

Currently, those quality of life features include
- Customizable flag messages (technically also I18n by using resource packs)
- Internationalization (I18n) through resource packs

_More client side, but optional, features are planned._
