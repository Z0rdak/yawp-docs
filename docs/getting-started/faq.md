- **Q**: How do I use this mod? Where do I start?
- **A**: Take a look at the [Getting Started](../getting-started/installation) page of the wiki.

If you still have questions or problems the wiki can't answer (please try first - I've created it for a reason), don't hesitate to visit our [discord](https://discord.gg/d7hArKCUtm) server to ask for help.

***

- **Q**: Do I need to install this mod on my client as well?
- **A**: No. YAWP only needs to be added to your server! A client side installation does provide a Resource Pack with language keys and maybe more later down the road..

***

- **Q**: Can you implement a flag for \<your feature here\>?
- **A**: Maybe. Take a look at the already listed [Flag Suggestions](https://github.com/Z0rdak/Yet-Another-World-Protector/issues/66) at the Issue-Tracker. If you don't find your flag there, consider adding it or visit our discord and propose a suggestion.

***
- **Q**: My configuration seems to reset itself? WHY?!?!?
- **A**: Make sure you save the file properly **and** close it. The configuration should be reloaded automatically.

Note: You can also disable the automatic config reload in the configuration for the ForgeConfigApi mod.

**Note**: If you have trouble getting the configuration to take effect, try using `/reload`. If the config values still reset, you may want to try to shut down the server, change the configuration and restart the server afterward. If the configuration keeps resetting, this may because it is formatted incorrectly.

Feel free to reach out to me at our [Discord](https://discord.gg/d7hArKCUtm) server for help.

***

- **Q**: Can I exclude blocks/entities/items from flags?
- **A**: Not yet! I am working on that feature for the next update!

***

- **Q**: Will there be a back-port of YAWP for Fabric 1.16.5?
- **A**: No, sorry. But If you want to contribute by porting the mod back to 1.16.5, you have my full support to do so.
