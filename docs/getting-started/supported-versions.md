Below you will find a table of all supported mod loaders and MC versions YAWP supports. 

The wiki is up-to-date with the latest version of YAWP and tries to maintain most major versions above YAWP `0.6.2-beta1`.
Please note that this wiki does not include information comprehensive information about all previous versions of YAWP.

Because YAWP is still very actively in development and new features getting added frequently and changes to existing features are still happening, 
it's not possible to maintain all versions.

This is why, from time to time YAWP will drop support for older versions. This is often due to
- new bigger MC versions being released
- minor updates (like 1.21.9) just being hotfixes
- minor versions (like 1.20.2) not being adopted by a wide range of players

## Version overview

The latest YAWP version can always be found at the main branch of the [mod repository](https://github.com/Z0rdak/Yet-Another-World-Protector). It is available for the versions marked with :ballot_box_with_check:
